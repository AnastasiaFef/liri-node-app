Lyrics for Mockingbird by Eminem :

Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your mom
And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad
Even when you smile
Even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes
Deep inside, you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared
I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying
Wipe them tears
Daddy's here
No more nightmares
We gonna pull together through it
We gon' do it
Laney, uncle's crazy ain't he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins
When it swirls
When it whirls
When it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Looking puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move
Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it
But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that
The more it backfires on me
All the things, growing up
As daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see
But you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way
Your mother and me
...

Lyrics for The Sign by Ace of Base :

I
I got a new life
You would hardly recognize me
I'm so glad
How can a person like me care for you
Why do I bother
When you're not the one for me

Is enough enough
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong

Lyrics for Beautiful Liar - Main Version / Album Version by Beyoncé Shakira :

Ay, ay, ay
Nobody likes being played
Oh, Beyoncé, Beyoncé
Oh, Shakira, Shakira (hey)
He said I'm worth it, his one desire
I know things about ‘em that you wouldn't wanna read about
He kissed me, his one and only, beautiful liar
Tell me how you tolerate the things you just found out about
You never know
Why are we the ones who suffer
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry
(Ay) let's not kill the karma
(Ay) let's not start a fight
(Ay) it's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
(Oh) can't we laugh about it
(Oh) it's not worth our time
